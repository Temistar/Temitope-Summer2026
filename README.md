**Temitope Adeniyi**  
PhD Student | Quantum Computing | AI | Science Policy  

Hi! I’m Temitope, a PhD student in Computer Science at Cleveland State University, working at the intersection of quantum computing, machine learning, and science policy. I’m currently available for Summer 2025 opportunities. I’m open to remote, short-term, or project-based roles where I can contribute to ongoing work in:

- Quantum circuit optimisation and sensing
- Quantum machine learning and hybrid models
- Quantum error mitigation
- Curriculum design and STEM education
- Science and technology policy
